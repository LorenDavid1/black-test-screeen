                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Android devices boast vibrant displays, but sometimes tiny imperfections like dead or stuck pixels can mar the experience. These small defects might go unnoticed during everyday use but can become apparent in certain scenarios. This guide will walk you through identifying these issues on your Android phone or tablet, helping you maintain optimal screen quality without relying on professional services immediately.</p>

                <h2>What Are Dead and Stuck Pixels?</h2>
                <p>Pixels are the building blocks of your screen, each capable of displaying millions of colors. A dead pixel fails completely, often appearing as a permanent black dot because it receives no power or signal. In contrast, a stuck pixel remains fixed on a single color—red, green, or blue—due to a sub-pixel malfunction, refusing to change with the display content.</p>

                <h2>Differences Between Dead and Stuck Pixels</h2>
                <p>While both can disrupt your viewing, dead pixels are hardware failures that typically don't fix themselves and might indicate broader screen issues. Stuck pixels, however, are often software-related or temporary, sometimes resolvable through simple methods like screen cycling or rest. Recognizing the type helps determine if a repair is necessary or if home remedies might suffice.</p>

                <h2>Why Check for These Pixels?</h2>
                <p>Early detection prevents minor annoyances from escalating. For new devices, spotting defects within the warranty period can lead to free replacements. Regular checks also ensure your screen performs at its best for gaming, video watching, or professional tasks, potentially saving on costly repairs down the line.</p>

                <h2>Preparation Before Testing</h2>
                <p>Dim the room lights to reduce glare. Gently wipe your screen with a microfiber cloth to remove dust or smudges that could mimic pixel issues. Maximize brightness settings on your device for clearer visibility of anomalies.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Spotting Pixels</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open a full-screen app or website that displays solid colors (black, white, red, green, blue).</li>
                    <li>Scan the screen meticulously in a dark environment, looking for dots that don't match the uniform color.</li>
                    <li>Switch between colors to identify stuck sub-pixels, which might only appear on specific backgrounds.</li>
                    <li>Rotate the device to check in different orientations, as some defects show variably.</li>
                    <li>Note any suspicious spots and retest to confirm they're not temporary glitches.</li>

                <h2>Tools and Apps for Detection</h2>
                <p>Utilize free Android apps from the Play Store that cycle through solid colors automatically. Alternatively, web-based testers work via your browser in full-screen mode. These tools simplify the process by eliminating the need for manual image switching.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You Find One</h2>
                <p>For stuck pixels, try running color-cycling videos for hours or applying gentle pressure with a soft cloth (at your own risk). Dead pixels often require professional repair or device replacement. Check your warranty status promptly.</p>
